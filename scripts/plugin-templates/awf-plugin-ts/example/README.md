### Description

This is an actual application with only one plugin ({{name}}).

By default it will try to make links via `npm link` to the `awf-plugin-loader` and `akasha-sdk`, however, if it fails for some reason make sure you manually link those packages (you can do it with `lerna`).

Use it only for development!
You won't need to change anything in this folder, however if you have an edge case, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/AkashaProject/akasha-sdk-js/issues)


### Starting the app

`npm start`

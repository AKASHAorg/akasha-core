The Legal app is the repository where all legal documents related to the current World are displayed. The AKASHA Foundation built this application to empower you to have the full visibility of the governance rules and information related with your access to and use of the current World including how we collect, use, store and share personal information about you. This way you have a meaningful control over the decisions you make and rules you agree to be bound by when you interact with the World.

The Antenna app displays a list of beams and reflections in a feed-like manner sorted in chronological order.

Some of the core components in the Antenna are the Global Antenna and My Antenna pages.

This is a place to share ideas and connect with the AKASHA World community. You can talk to everything and everyone and collaborate with the wonderful members of the community to support ideas, causes and projects. You can share your thoughts (links, photos and videos), find out what's going on in the AKASHA World and join fascinating conversations. 

Here are some tips to get the most out of your AKASHA World experience:

- mention people in any of your beams in order to create and expand your network or create personal connections. These people will get notified and chances are they’ll come back to you in a blink of an eye!
- create hashtags by adding a `#` at the beginning of a word when posting so you make it easier for you and the community to follow topics.
- use the General Antenna page to stay tuned on what is going on in the World. Beams are listed in a chronological way and you’ll be able to manage them by using a set of features provided by the Antenna app or other applications.

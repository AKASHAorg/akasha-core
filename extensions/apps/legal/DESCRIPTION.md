The Legal app is the repository where all legal documents related to the current World are displayed. 

The AKASHA Foundation built this application to empower you as a World user to have the full visibility of the governance rules and information related with your access to and use of the current World. This way you have a meaningful control over the decisions you make and the rules you agree to be bound by when interacting with the World.

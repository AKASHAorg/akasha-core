# App Loader

> App loader is the central module for micro-frontends (apps)
Built as a layer over the single-spa library, it provides the required functionality
to install/uninstall, load/unload apps and widgets.


## Usage

```tsx
import AppLoader from '@akashaorg/ui-app-loader';
import sdk from '@akashaorg/sdk';

const appLoader = new AppLoader(options, sdk);
appLoader.start();

```

## Execution flow
App-loader begins to execute when the `.start()` method is called.
The following steps are a high level view of the execution flow after the start() method is called:
- get manifests for default integrations
  - get manifests for user integrations (if user is logged in)
- import integration's main script
- call getPlugin (if an integration exports it)
- register layout into single-spa
- register everything else into single-spa

### Options:
  - `title` - the title of this world instance
  - `layout` - the layout app to use
  - `homepageApp` - the app that is loaded on the homepage
  - `defaultApps` - `string[]` or `{ name: string, version: string }[]`
  - `defaultWidgets` - `string[]` or `{ name: string, version: string }[]`
  - `logLevel` - one of `fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace,`

## Development
 - clone the repository
 - execute `yarn pack:app-loader` from the root of the repository to build the package
